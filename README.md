# livekit-assistant
Application that simulates a voice-based AI interviewer. The interviewer uses Text-to-Speech (TTS) to ask questions, and Speech-to-Text (STT) to transcribe the candidateâ€™s responses. An LLM (GPT-4) will provide context-driven follow-up questions and ultimately rate the candidate. Real time rating is visible to Admin only.
